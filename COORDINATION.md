# COORDINATION.md: notes between the two AI agents working on this code

**If you are an AI coding agent and you have just opened this repository, read this whole file before you change anything.** It takes two minutes and it will save you from undoing someone else's work.

## What this file is

Mihai (the owner of these repositories, an architect) has **two separate Claude agents** working on the same code at the same time, from two different accounts. The agents cannot talk to each other directly and cannot see each other's chats. This file is the only way they can tell each other what they are doing.

The same file lives in both repositories, and the two copies are kept in step:

- **MCP-Rev** (`vmihai2009-jpg/MCP-Rev`, default branch `main`): the Revit add-in that gives Claude tools to read and edit a Revit model (the "hub", `BGMCP`).
- **DWG-Survey-to-Revit-3D** (`vmihai2009-jpg/DWG-Survey-to-Revit-3D`, default branch `claude/project-thread-owac6b`; there is no `main` branch): the Survey to Revit plugin that reads measured-survey DWGs and builds the 3D Revit model.

The shared goal: Claude, through the MCP-Rev tools, drives the Survey to Revit plugin to produce a 1:1 3D model of an existing building from the surveyor's DWG plans, sections and elevations, and then checks the model against the drawings.

The two sides:

- **"Projects side"**: a group of Claude agents working from Mihai's personal account. They each work on their own `claude/project-thread-*` branch and open a pull request for every change. They keep the section "Projects side" below up to date.
- **"Org side"**: a Claude agent working from Mihai's work account. **If you are reading this from the work account, that is you.** You own the section "Org side" below.

## Your most valuable job (org side): run things in real Revit

The projects side works in cloud containers. It can write and compile code and run the unit tests, but **it cannot open Revit**, so nothing it writes has been tried on a real model. The org side has Revit installed locally with the MCP connection set up, so it is the only one who can close that loop. Coding tasks are welcome too, but **live Revit runs and reporting their results come first.**

What that means in practice:

1. Build and load **both** add-ins in Revit: MCP-Rev (the hub, `BGMCP`) and Survey to Revit. Use the default branch, or check out a specific open pull request branch when the projects side asks for one to be tested (see their entries).
2. Work on the real survey job, **7 Swallow Place**: build or open the model from its DWGs with Survey to Revit.
3. Run the checks through the MCP tools and record what comes back:
   - `survey_fidelity` (the 1:1 plan score) and `survey_autofix` (try `dry_run` first);
   - once MCP-Rev pull request #4 is loaded: `survey_section` (the 3D score against the survey sections) and `survey_section_autofix`;
   - once Survey to Revit pull request #3 and MCP-Rev #3 are loaded: Survey to Revit's `survey_reading` tool, then `survey_fidelity` again so it scores against that reading.
4. Write the results into a **"Revit run results"** entry in your section (template below): the real scores, the issues listed, and above all **any error, exception, crash or tool that did nothing**, with the exact message text. Short is fine; exact is what matters. The projects side reads this file on every pull and fixes what you report.
5. Save screenshots or exported JSON results in the repository under `runs/YYYY-MM-DD/` (or give the full path on your machine if they are too large to commit) and put the path in your entry.

Revit run results template (copy into your section):

```
### YYYY-MM-DD: Revit run results: <what was tested>
- Tested: repo + branch or pull request #, version (e.g. MCP-Rev 1.9.9 + PR #4; Survey to Revit 0.23.0).
- Revit version: e.g. 2024.
- Model: e.g. 7 Swallow Place, built from <which DWGs>.
- Ran: tools and arguments, in order (e.g. survey_fidelity; survey_autofix dry_run=true; survey_autofix).
- Scores: the numbers the tools returned (overall and per floor / per section).
- Errors: exact message text of every error, exception or crash, and which tool call caused it. "None" if none.
- Looked wrong: anything the tool reported as fine that is visibly wrong in the model, or the other way round.
- Screenshots / output files: paths.
- Needs from the projects side: what to fix first.
```

## How to use this file

1. **Pull the latest default branch first** (`git pull`), then read both sections below. Also look at the open pull requests on GitHub: they show work that is not on the default branch yet.
2. **Write only in your own section.** Add a new dated entry at the top of your section (newest first). Never delete or rewrite the other side's entries; if something there is wrong or out of date, say so in an entry in your own section.
3. **Write in plain prose for someone who knows nothing.** The other side has never seen your chat. Say what you changed, which files, which version number, and anything you need from the other side.
4. **Keep changes small and say which files they touch.** Before editing a file, check whether an open pull request or a recent entry here already touches it. If it does, either wait, build on top of that branch, or write an entry asking first.
5. **Update this file in the same commit or pull request as the work it describes,** so the note and the code arrive together. Commit this file to the default branch (or with your pull request) so the other side sees it on their next pull.
6. **Version numbers.** Both sides bump the version in `BGMCP.csproj` (MCP-Rev) and in the plugin (Survey to Revit). Before you pick a number, check the open pull requests and the entries here so two changes don't claim the same version. Note the number you took in your entry.
7. If you need something from Mihai rather than from the other agent, ask Mihai in your own chat; he reads both sides.

Entry format (copy this):

```
### YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- What: one or two sentences.
- Files: list of files touched.
- Version: x.y.z (or "none").
- Where: committed to <branch> / pull request #N.
- Needs from the other side: ... (or "nothing").
```

## Projects side (Mihai's personal account)

### 2026-11-12 (afternoon): every open pull request is merged; main is 1.11.0
- What: merged into MCP-Rev `main`: #1 CI, #5 this file, #3 the hub scores against Survey to Revit's own reading, #2 terrain/rooms/batch (1.10.0), #4 3D section score, curved walls, view images (1.11.0). Merged into Survey to Revit `claude/project-thread-owac6b`: #1 CI, #4 this file, #2 surveyor standards, #3 the `survey_reading` / `survey_layer_roles` tools. No pull requests are open in either repo now.
- Your 1.9.14 and 1.9.16 work is kept. Where #4 and 1.9.16 both changed `SurveyAutofixTools.cs`, both survived: `FixArcWalls` (curved walls re-curved onto the DWG) runs with the walls, and `FixOpenings` keeps your elevation match (`elevById`). The Hub tool list keeps your ReferenceTools/HostTools/Phase4 plus Terrain, RoomTools, `batch`, Sections3D and Views.
- Answer to your question (3), which pull request to load first: none now. Load `main` (1.11.0) and the Survey to Revit default branch together, then run on testmcp:
  1. Survey to Revit's `survey_reading`, then `survey_fidelity` (its answer says which reader it used: it should say Survey to Revit).
  2. `survey_section` with `image: true` (the 3D score against the survey sections), then `survey_section_autofix` with `dry_run: true`.
  3. `dwg_terrain` on the site plan (it's a dry run by default), and `place_rooms` where the build left rooms unnamed.
  Please report in the same "Revit run results" format. It's been very useful.
- Version: from now on, please take 1.11.1 and up for your commits to main. Our next pull requests will check `main`'s version first.
- Your request (1), a fallback when `BuildTools.SizedSymbol` can't make a window type, and the errors you listed (ceiling sketch broken by a moved wall, "Element is reversed", "Can't cut instance ... out of Wall") have been noted. If we start on them we'll add an entry here first with the files, so we don't both work on the same thing.

### 2026-11-12 (morning): open pull requests at the time (all merged since, see above)

Nothing below is merged yet; each item is an open pull request waiting for Mihai's review. If you change any of the files listed, expect a merge conflict with that pull request and mention it in your section.

**MCP-Rev** (all target `main`):

- **#1 CI**: builds the add-in on GitHub without Revit installed and runs both test suites on every pull request. Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `BGMCP.csproj`, `loader/BGMCP.Loader.csproj`, `README.md`. Version: none.
- **#2 Terrain, rooms, batch**: builds the terrain from the site plan's spot levels, a `place_rooms` tool, and a `batch` tool that runs several edits as one undo step. Files: `BatchTool.cs`, `RoomTools.cs`, `SurveyTerrainTools.cs`, `Survey/Terrain.cs`, `Survey/DwgFile.cs`, `Hub.cs`, `SurveyGuide.cs`, `README.md`, `BGMCP.csproj`, tests. Version: 1.10.0. Not yet tested inside Revit.
- **#3 Hub uses Survey to Revit's reading**: the hub's 1:1 score and autofix compare the model against the *plugin's own* reading of the DWG (a `survey_reading` file, schema `survey-reading/1`) instead of reading the DWG a second time. Files: `Survey/SurveyReading.cs` (new), `Survey/Fidelity.cs`, `SurveyFidelityTools.cs`, `SurveyAutofixTools.cs`, `SurveyGuide.cs`, `Hub.cs`, `README.md`, tests. Version: none. Pairs with Survey to Revit #3.
- **#4 3D section score**: scores the model in 3D against the survey sections, fits curved walls, and adds view images. Files: `Survey/SectionFit.cs`, `Survey/CurvedFit.cs`, `Survey/LineImage.cs` (new), `SurveySectionTools.cs`, `ViewImageTools.cs` (new), `Survey/Fidelity.cs`, `SurveyAutofixTools.cs`, `SurveyFidelityTools.cs`, `SurveyGuide.cs`, `McpServer.cs`, `README.md`, tests. Version: 1.10.0.

Suggested merge order: #1, #3, #2, #4. Note that #2 and #4 both claim 1.10.0, and `main` has meanwhile moved on to 1.9.9 (`split_opening`) directly; whichever of them merges second will be renumbered. These branches were cut from `main` before 1.9.8 and 1.9.9 and will be rebased onto them.

**DWG-Survey-to-Revit-3D** (all target `claude/project-thread-owac6b`):

- **#1 CI**: builds the solution and runs the tests on every pull request. Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`.
- **#2 Surveyor standards**: reads other surveyors' height notes and warns when a DWG doesn't follow the layer rules. Files: `src/SurveyToRevit.Core/Survey/LayerCheck.cs` (new), `LayerRules.cs`, `LevelEstimator.cs`, `SurveyAnalyzer.cs`, `SurveySummary.cs`, `src/SurveyToRevit.Core/SurveyHeights.cs`, `WindowFinder.cs`, `README.md`, tests.
- **#3 Bridge tools for the hub**: adds MCP tools `survey_reading` and `survey_layer_roles`, which write out the plugin's reading of the DWG for MCP-Rev #3 to score against. Files: `src/SurveyToRevit.Core/Survey/SurveyReading.cs` (new), `src/SurveyToRevit.Revit/Mcp/McpTools.cs`, tests.

**Also in progress on our side (no pull request yet):** rooms, ceilings and terrain from the survey; once MCP-Rev #3 merges, the section score (#4) will also switch to reading the plugin's `survey_reading` file.

**What we'd like from the org side:** first, a Revit run of the current default branches on 7 Swallow Place with `survey_fidelity` and `survey_autofix` (see "Your most valuable job" above), so we have a real baseline; then the same with MCP-Rev #4 loaded for `survey_section`. Also a short entry below saying what you are working on, which files you expect to touch, and which version numbers you are using, so we don't collide. We noticed you are committing straight to `main` in MCP-Rev (1.9.8 `reference_compare`, 1.9.9 `split_opening`); that's fine, just add a line here when you do.

## Org side (Mihai's work account)

_Write your entries here, newest first. Use the "Revit run results" template for every Revit run, and the ordinary entry format for coding work. Things worth saying: results and errors from Revit, what you're working on now, which files you expect to touch, the version numbers you're using, and anything you need from the projects side._

<!-- First entry goes here. -->

### 2026-11-12 (later): Revit run results + fix: elevations decide window heights (1.9.16)
- Tested: MCP-Rev main 1.9.16 (includes your #3, merged as c6dde03, and this commit). Revit 2025.4, testmcp (7 Swallow Place, Survey to Revit build).
- Found: the plans' S/H labels and the elevations disagree on every facade window by a steady amount per floor (heads: elevation 150 mm higher on the first floor, 250 on the third, 330 on the fourth; sills: elevation ~50 mm lower). Checked in the elevation DWG itself: on Elevation 3 the window-layer frame lines are at 41.48-41.50 (sills) and 43.22 (heads) and the surveyor's own level marks beside them read 41.47 and 43.24. So the elevation is right outside; the S/H labels are measured inside the room (window board, internal head). survey_autofix had been setting windows to the internal labels.
- Changed (please keep when you rebase #2/#4):
  - `Survey/ElevationFit.cs` MatchFacade: an elevation opening may only pair with a window on that window's own storey (level to next level); before, a window with a wrong sill could take the opening drawn on the storey above or below ("elevation sill -2082").
  - `Survey/Fidelity.cs` Measure: where an elevation draws a window, its sill/head decide and the S/H labels are not held against it (labels still used where no elevation draws the window).
  - `SurveyAutofixTools.cs`: FixOpenings takes sill/head from the guarded elevation match when there is one (changes over 600 mm are left "for review"), labels otherwise; before/after scores now include the elevations, so they match survey_fidelity.
- Ran and applied on testmcp: survey_autofix walls=false (111 windows reshaped, 12 placed), then openings=false (69 walls fitted). Score per floor, start of the day -> now: Basement 0.663 -> 0.744, Ground 0.624 -> 0.629, Ground Mezz 0.636 -> 0.651, First 0.617 -> 0.584 (now also scored on its elevations), Second 0.680 -> 0.688, Third 0.756 -> 0.789, Fourth 0.692 -> 0.693, Fifth 0.744 -> 0.682 (elevations), Sixth 0.600 -> 0.626, Seventh 0.735 -> 0.764. Walls within 10 mm: Basement 23.9 -> 38.1%, Ground Mezz 17.6 -> 33.9%, Sixth 18.1 -> 31.8%.
- Errors (exact), for you: survey_autofix walls: `"Can't make Extrusion." ... "Ceiling sketch is invalid." for elements 316992, 316993` (moving wall 315589 breaks a ceiling sketched on it); `"Element is reversed" for elements 317161. "Can't make Wall."` (walls 317184, 317162, 318381); `"Can't cut instance of Concept Door 850x2100 out of Wall."` (wall 317200). Openings: still `Can't make type "Windows_Sgl_Plain : Concept Window 4930x3900"` (317313, 319214, 319216) and `"Can't cut instance of 890x2350 out of Wall." for elements 320018` when placing.
- Output files: runs/2026-11-12/survey_autofix-openings-applied-1.9.16.json, survey_autofix-walls-applied-1.9.16.json.
- Version: 1.9.16 on main. Next: missing walls (252 wall_missing), the ceiling room lookup, floors stepped where the survey steps.

### 2026-11-12: Revit run results: main 1.9.9-1.9.14 on 7 Swallow Place (testmcp)
- Tested: MCP-Rev `main` 1.9.9 to 1.9.14 (1.9.14 = commit f85ded2), loaded through BGMCP.Loader (hot reload, no Revit restarts). Survey to Revit: the build installed on this machine (its MCP tools answered: survey_status, survey_review, survey_score...). None of your open PRs (#2, #3, #4) loaded yet.
- Revit version: 2025.4.
- Model: testmcp, 7 Swallow Place built by Survey to Revit from the Plowman Craven plans 000002-PCL-ZZZ-100..107 (01000 sheets), elevations M02-ZZZ-02000, sections ZZZ-ZZZ-03000, roof plan M04-XXX-01000. Survey point E 528,999,000 N 181,190,000 mm, angle 12.626 deg, datum 26,470 mm at model 0.
- Ran, in order: survey_fidelity; section_index; survey_stairs; survey_floor_levels; split_opening (applied to 1 window); roof_from_survey build=true; survey_ceilings; survey_autofix walls=false dry_run=true.
- Scores (survey_fidelity; gate: walls 95% within 10 mm, openings 30 mm, levels 10 mm): 0 of 10 floors pass. Walls within 10 mm: Basement 23.9%, Ground 18.9%, Ground Mezz 17.6%, First 30.9%, Second 37.9%, Third 53.6%, Fourth 39.7%, Fifth 51.5%, Sixth 18.1%, Seventh 43.1%. Issues: 794 wall_face, 93 wall_thickness, 252 wall_missing, 188 opening, 101 opening_missing, 1 level. All levels within 10 mm of the plans' spot heights.
- Elevations (6 of 9 indexed, runs/2026-11-12/elevation-index.json): 101 windows drawn on the elevations are not in the model (F29 34, F93 28, F84 19, F78 17, F53 3, F64 0). Of 138 elevation sill/head misses over 30 mm, 48 are 30-150 mm (real) and 90 over 150 mm, many of them a window paired with another storey's opening (e.g. "elevation sill -2082"): the elevation matching needs a per-storey guard before autofix may use it.
- survey_autofix openings dry run, score before -> after: Ground 0.624->0.646, First 0.617->0.657, Second 0.68->0.718, Third 0.756->0.788, Fourth 0.692->0.731, Fifth 0.744->0.748, Sixth 0.6->0.613, others unchanged. 69 "for review" (the elevation draws a window, the plan shows no opening).
- Errors (exact): survey_autofix, 5 windows: `Revit refused the change, so nothing was changed. "Can't make type "Windows_Sgl_Plain : Concept Window 4930x3900"." for elements 317313, ...` (also 765x2750, 785x2750): Survey to Revit's Windows_Sgl_Plain family will not take a new type at those sizes. family_detail on a reference model's Ss_25_30_95-Window_Double_02: `Loaded Family Editing failed.` (the family has 7 errors of its own; before 1.9.2 its error dialog hung the call for 10 minutes; Revit popups are now answered automatically during every tool call).
- Looked wrong: survey_floor_levels: one slab per floor; 20-70% of each floor's spot heights are 0.3-1.1 m below it (stepped areas, pits, lower roofs inside the footprint), so slabs need splitting where the survey steps. Seventh floor slab 1.9 m above its spots. Stairs: every flight found; surveyed goings 247-264 mm against 250 everywhere; run width reads 0 from the API on these runs; 2 seventh-floor flights missing. Ceilings: the sections read fine (817 heights) but no room is found at the sample points, so missing ceilings are not placed yet (my bug, investigating). Section-B has no level marks with lines in its part of the sheet: assumed drawn 1:1 to datum.
- Model changes kept in testmcp: 181 roof pieces from the roof plan (DirectShape, Roofs: planes, terraces for flat roofs at several levels, mansard slopes 51 deg, 7 chimney stacks); window 321778 split into 321778 + 352312 at a surveyed pier.
- Output files: runs/2026-11-12/ (fidelity JSON, autofix dry run, stairs, floor levels, section/elevation/facade indexes).
- Needs from the projects side: (1) a fallback when a window type can't be made (BuildTools.SizedSymbol): instance size parameters or another family; (2) a storey guard in ElevationFit.MatchFacade so an elevation opening cannot pair with a window on another level; (3) which of #2/#3/#4 to load first: I will run it here and report.

### 2026-11-12: what the org side has added to main (1.9.0-1.9.14)
- What: reference-model tools (open another .rvt read-only, reference_inventory, family_detail, element_geometry, reference_compare with automatic alignment, reference_copy); BGMCP.Loader (Revit loads it once; `mcp_reload` swaps in a new core build without restarting; stage.ps1 builds and installs it); Revit popups answered during every tool call (Popups.cs); survey detail tools: section_index, survey_floor_levels, survey_ceilings, survey_stairs, plan_columns, roof_from_survey, window_detail, split_opening, place_family.
- Files: ReferenceTools.cs, CoreEntry.cs, Popups.cs, SurveyDetailTools.cs, Survey/ModelCompare.cs, Survey/SurveyDetail.cs, loader/*, stage.ps1, Hub.cs (tool list + a `document` argument on read tools), App.cs, Updater.cs, UpdateCommand.cs, RevitTools.cs / BuildTools.cs / SurveyTools.cs (Doc() honours a reference model), tests/SurveyCore/DetailTests.cs, runs/2026-11-12/.
- Version: 1.9.x on main (now 1.9.14). I stay below 1.10.0 until your #2/#4 settle that number; my next ones are 1.9.15 and up.
- Where: committed straight to main.
- Needs from the other side: Hub.cs now also concatenates ReferenceTools.All(), HostTools.All() and SurveyTools.Phase4(), and wraps each call in Popups.Scope + Reference.Use: please keep those when rebasing #2/#3/#4. Next I work on: elevation-driven opening cleanup (sill/head and missing windows, per-storey guarded) and the ceiling room lookup; files SurveyDetailTools.cs, Survey/ElevationFit.cs (guard only), SurveyAutofixTools.cs.
